# Amazon Front Page Clone  

This is a simple Amazon front page clone built using HTML and CSS.  
It was created as a practice project to improve my web development skills.  

## Features
- Amazon-like header and footer  
- Navigation bar with hover effects  
- Product grid (static layout)  
- "See More" button with hover animation  

## Notes
- The project is not yet fully responsive, so it works best on larger screens.  
- Future updates will include responsiveness for mobile and tablet.
